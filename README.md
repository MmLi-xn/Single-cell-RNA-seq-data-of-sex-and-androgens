# Single-cell-RNA-seq-data-of-sex-and-androgens
# Codes provided here are to define and visualize the DEGs, AASB-DEGs and significantly enriched biological pathways in each cell type of 17 tissues.
# DEGs: p-adjust < 0.05 and |Log2FC| > 0.5.
# AASB-DEGs: androgen-associated sex-biased DEGs (AASB-DEGs) for each cell type across the 17 tissues comprises positive AASB-DEGs (the expression levels of which were male-biased and positively regulated by androgens) and negative AASB-DEGs (the expression levels of which were female-biased and negatively regulated by androgens)
# Significantly enriched biological pathways: Gene Ontology: Biological Process, p < 0.01 & q < 0.01.
